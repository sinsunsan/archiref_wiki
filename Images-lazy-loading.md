### What it is ? 

* Load images only when there could be visible on screen > to save bandwidth 
* Display a placeholder or div wrapping the image before it load (need to know its proportion height x width)
* Could also display a loading effet, transition, spinner... when the image is actually loading 

### How 

By not setting the src attributes of img tag, but settings it dynamically with js
