### Parallax explained 

* a difference of scroll speed between elements of the page. 
for exemple without parallax an element has 
1px scrolled = 1 pixel offset in the scroll direction

With a parallax ratio : we set the difference related to normal deplacement 
0.5 ratio mean 0,5x the normal deplacement 
300 pixel scrolled = 150 pixel deplacement 
- mean the direction, a negative number mean scrolling in the inverse direction as the main scroll
