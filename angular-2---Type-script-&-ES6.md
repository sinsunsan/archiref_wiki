Modules types as  described by web pack documentation

* <script>-tag style (without a module system)
* CommonJS

* a clear explanation of why there is so much version of modern javascripts http://learnangular2.com/es6/

How does this compare to JSPM/SystemJS?


### JSPM vs ROLLUP 

`JSPM is awesome, and it uses Rollup in its builder! In addition to bundling modules, it also combines a repository with a package manager and a client-side module loader. JSPM allows you to use any module format and even develop without a build step, so it's a great choice for creating applications. Stand-alone Rollup doesn't use the complex SystemJS format, making it a better choice for creating libraries.`

## Typescript 

http://learnangular2.com/es6/

> Typescript is Microsoft’s extension of JS that comes with powerful type checking abilities and object oriented features. Both Angular 2 and Ionic 2 use TypeScript.

> If you’d like to develop with “plain” ES6 and ES7, you can use Babel, the “compiler for writing next generation JavaScript.” If you’d like to use Ionic and Angular, we recommend TypeScript which will provide similar features as babel, with extra type checking if you choose to use it.
