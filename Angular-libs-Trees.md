### Tables + tree 
* **angular tree grid**   https://github.com/khan4019/tree-grid-directive
Don't have the drag & drop like Angular tree dnd, but it seem that it is easier to setup. 
The column are auto set with object key name, which is great to quickly have a result. 
It is possible to define custom templates for cells, in a optional directive attributes.

The icon class name can be easily changed to use font awesome instead of default glyphicon.

* **Angular tree dnd** Powerful tree with tables, list, drag and drop...
