Looking at open source project settings is very informative to discover grunt plugin and copy some settings 
Like : 

* https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/Gruntfile.js

And some tutorials :

Verbose mode & debugging

> For a long time in my early grunting I didn't know you could see more task output by adding the -v flag to a command. Some tasks opt for extended logging in verbose mode, and in that case, setting this flag can expose more information about a task if it's not functioning as expected.

> If you need to look further into debugging a task by seeing a stack trace, you can also set the --stack flag.
