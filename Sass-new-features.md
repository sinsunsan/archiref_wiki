### MAPS#section10
> Maps are a data type (like numbers, strings, and lists) in Sass 3.3 that behave in a similar way to objects in JavaScript. They are comprised of key/value pairs, where keys and values can be any of Sassâ€™s data types (including maps themselves). Keys are always unique and can be retrieved by name, making them ideal for unique storage and retrieval.

```` Sass
$properties: (
	background: red,
	color: blue,
	font-size: 1em,
	font-family: (Helvetica, arial, sans-serif)
);

.foo {
	color: map-get($properties, color);
}
