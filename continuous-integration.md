Continuous integration is a technic that allow to work in a team of developer in a saner way. 
All developer commits their change in a integration server several times a day. 

### Why using Continuous integration 

* Always evaluate the consequence of others changes and don't fall in the integration hell, where the integration of the changes of a dev take more time that the time to code it.?
* Put in production small chunk of code more testable 
* Don't wait a whole module to be finished to have feedback from your users that you can have early feedbacks and make changes. 
* Automate the build and test process (as the build occurs several time a day, it's necessary to automate it, which is a good practice [[industrialisation]]
