* Choose between em or rem 
* Define precise typo font-size list (like colors) using modular scale or not 
* define line-height in percentage to be able to move relative to font-size

    * class 
    * combination of class
* Are padding and margin are defined with text ?
    * advantage : consistent paragrapher spacing ....
