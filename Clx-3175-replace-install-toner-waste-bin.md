> Why are you people beating the shit out of your printers? You don’t have to cut wires, disable the LED or break off the switch. All you have to do is clean the waste toner container properly. When you dump it or like I do vacuum it there is still residue on the inside of the container and if the laser light can’t see through it still thinks the container is full.

If you take a garden hose or rinse it under the sink until the plastic container is clear again the laser can see through and it thinks it is a new container. Let the water drops dry before putting it back in your printer. THIS WORKS!!
