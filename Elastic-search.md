### Launch elastic search 

To launch the process 
```
/bin/elasticsearch
```
* Port 9300 // Communication between node
* Port 9200 // Rest api call


### Make basic rest api calls
```
curl localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
```
Where 
 
* _cluster is the name of the cluster as defined in the config file
* health is a special query to get the health (system state) of the cluster.
* ?pretty is a parameter to tell to output the json in prettified format


### Rest API call structure 

/World/people/slucas 
where slucas is the id of a json document containing information about user slucas

/Index/type/id 


#### Documents Id

in /World/people/slucas  we have used the id slucas 

If we want to have an auto generated id, we just leabe /World/people/
It will auto populate the id 

#### Document source

The document source is the plain json document not modified by elastic. 
It is available in the json object under _source

#### API verbs 

* POST to create a record 
* PUT to update a record (passing the full json object)
* DELETE to delete a record
