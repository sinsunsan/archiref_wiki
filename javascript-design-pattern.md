### Design Patterns 

* [Facade](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#facadepatternjavascript) Simplifying a complex system, API, with a new facade, more easy to use api Ex: jquery relative to DOM API
* [Revealing Module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript) Ex: The service public method  in angular js / The way to reveal to the exterior world which methods are available including changing their naming
* [Singleton](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#singletonpatternjavascript) One unique instance of  a class. When a instance exist already instead of creating a new one we return a reference to the existing one.
* [Factory](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#factorypatternjavascript) Not a direct object creation trough new keyword but a guided creation in a way defined in the factory (my implementation of similar yet different controllers)
