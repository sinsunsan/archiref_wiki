* **Entity, Entity type, Bundle in d7**   
Drupal 7 has introduced entity and bundle terminology. 
Those objects are more generals that drupal 6 nodes, taxonomy terms, users....   
An entity is a something more general that node that has a type that could be "node" "terms" "users", "assets" ... The equivalent of the content type for d6 nodes are called bundle which is an assemblage of fields on a given entity. So the article node type in d6 would be the entity of type "node" and of bundle "article"
